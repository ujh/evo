# evo
Artificial intelligence for the game of Go using neural networks and genetic algorithms

_This is an experiment to see if genetic algorithms can be used to evolve a neural network for playing the game of Go. I don't expect this to be a good program anytime soon (or ever), I just want to play around._

## TODO

- [ ] Combine the [Brown](http://www.lysator.liu.se/%7Egunnar/gtp/brown-1.0.tar.gz) random Go engine with the [genann](https://github.com/codeplea/genann) neural network library so that it can read a network definiton from file and play a game.
- [ ] Write some scripts to generate NN, run tournaments, do the evolution, etc.
- [ ] Try evolving a engine for 9x9
